# TicTacToe

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game I develop while studying [Developing Android Apps with Kotlin](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud9012) course.

## Details

This app is written in Kotlin and uses modern android development stack such as Jetpack libraries.

Currently the app is implemented using the following:

- One main activity and various fragments.
- MVVM Architecture.
- Navigation using Jetpack Navigation, with safe-args to pass arguments safely between destinations
- Material Design components for a modern look and feel.
- Constraint Layout to provide a flexible UI with relative positioning.
- Jetpack lifecycle for adjusting behavior based on the current lifecycle state of each fragment.
- Room database, for storing played games details.
- Kotlin coroutines for handling asynchronous tasks such as inserting data to the database.
- RecyclerView for showing played games details.
